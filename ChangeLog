MDT 5.5   04-07-2020
====================
 - Add more Python 3 support to the build system.

MDT 5.4   05-25-2017
====================
 - Development is now open and hosted at GitHub.
 - Experimental cmake build support.
 - Installation packages now available for Homebrew
   ("brew tap salilab/salilab; brew install mdt") and
   Anaconda Python ("conda install -c salilab mdt").

MDT 5.3   05-19-2015
====================

 - A new function :func:`write_statpot` can generate a Modeller statistical
   potential file given a suitable input table.
 - A new feature :class:`~features.Cluster` allows clustering of two features
   into a single one.
 - A new feature :class:`~features.AtomTable` takes as input a table of
   precalculated per-atom values, and can be used to implement user-defined
   features or to use externally-calculated properties.
 - To save space, the data for the MDT table itself can be compressed when
   writing to an HDF5 file with :meth:`Table.write_hdf5`.
 - Certain library information (such as the mapping from feature values to
   bin indices, and atom or tuple class information) and information about
   the last scan is now written into MDT files in HDF5 format by
   :meth:`Table.write_hdf5`.
 - The maximum value of bond_span_range can now be -1, to allow atom pairs
   that have no path of bonds between them. This is helpful to include
   inter-chain interactions, for example.

MDT 5.2   10-29-2012
====================

 - A new method :meth:`Table.get_array_view` allows the raw MDT table data
   to be modified using NumPy functions.
 - Disulfide bonds can now be considered in the calculation of atom bond
   separation, by the :class:`~features.AtomBondSeparation` feature and
   the :meth:`Table.add_alignment` method.
 - Atoms in atom tuples can now be restricted to match only in certain
   residue types.

MDT 5.1   09-29-2011
====================

 - All atom features, with the exception of :class:`~features.AtomType`,
   are now considered undefined if the atom coordinates are equal to the
   Modeller undefined value (-999.0).
 - Support for bond separation, with a new :class:`~features.AtomBondSeparation`
   feature and a bond_span_range argument to :meth:`Table.add_alignment`.
 - Support Python 3 (requires Modeller 9.10 or later).
 - "scons test" now reports the Python coverage (and also C coverage,
   if using gcc and adding "coverage=true" to the scons command line).
 - The :class:`Table` constructor now takes an optional 'shape' argument,
   which acts identically to that accepted by :meth:`Table.reshape`.

MDT 5.0   03-31-2011
====================

 - First open source (GPLv2) release.
 - Duplicated Modeller Fortran code removed; MDT now uses Modeller itself for
   handling of protein structures and alignments.
 - Added scans over atom pairs, atom tuples, atom tuple pairs, and chemical
   bonds.
 - Complete documentation, examples, and unit tests added.
 - TOP scripting interface replaced with Python.
 - Support storing MDT tables in binary form, using the HDF5 format and
   library.

MDT 4.0  April 2002
===================

 - Reorganize directory structure.

MDT 3.1  March 2002
===================

 - Allow for a structure to be assessed against an existing MDT table.
