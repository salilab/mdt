 - A new method :meth:`Table.get_array_view` allows the raw MDT table data
   to be modified using NumPy functions.
 - Disulfide bonds can now be considered in the calculation of atom bond
   separation, by the :class:`~features.AtomBondSeparation` feature and
   the :meth:`Table.add_alignment` method.
 - Atoms in atom tuples can now be restricted to match only in certain
   residue types.
 - A new function :func:`write_statpot` can generate a Modeller statistical
   potential file given a suitable input table.

MDT 5.1   09-29-2011
====================

 - All atom features, with the exception of :class:`~features.AtomType`,
   are now considered undefined if the atom coordinates are equal to the
   Modeller undefined value (-999.0).
 - Support for bond separation, with a new :class:`~features.AtomBondSeparation`
   feature and a bond_span_range argument to :meth:`Table.add_alignment`.
 - Support Python 3 (requires Modeller 9.10 or later).
 - "scons test" now reports the Python coverage (and also C coverage,
   if using gcc and adding "coverage=true" to the scons command line).
 - The :class:`Table` constructor now takes an optional 'shape' argument,
   which acts identically to that accepted by :meth:`Table.reshape`.

MDT 5.0   03-31-2011
====================

 - First open source (GPLv2) release.
 - Duplicated Modeller Fortran code removed; MDT now uses Modeller itself for
   handling of protein structures and alignments.
 - Added scans over atom pairs, atom tuples, atom tuple pairs, and chemical
   bonds.
 - Complete documentation, examples, and unit tests added.
 - TOP scripting interface replaced with Python.
 - Support storing MDT tables in binary form, using the HDF5 format and
   library.

MDT 4.0  April 2002
===================

 - Reorganize directory structure.

MDT 3.1  March 2002
===================

 - Allow for a structure to be assessed against an existing MDT table.
