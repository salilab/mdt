To build MDT, simply type 'scons' in this directory. To run it, use
'scons install' to install it (you may need to set command line options to
install files in the correct locations - see 'scons -h') and then run MDT
scripts just like any other Python script. Alternatively, you can use the
bin/mdtpy.sh script to run MDT directly from the build directory. Simply
run it before your regular Python invocation (e.g. "bin/mdtpy.sh python foo.py")
