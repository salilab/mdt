<title>About &MDT;</title>

<para>
&MDT; prepares a raw frequency table, given information from &MODELLER;
alignments and/or &PDB; files. It can also process the raw frequency table in
several ways (e.g., normalization with
<ulink url="&epydoc;mdt.normalize">mdt.normalize</ulink>, smoothing with
<ulink url="&epydoc;mdt.smooth">mdt.smooth</ulink>), perform entropy
calculations with
<ulink url="&epydoc;mdt.entropy_full">mdt.entropy_full</ulink>, and write
out the data in various formats, including for plotting by &ASGL;
(<ulink url="&epydoc;mdt.write_asgl">mdt.write_asgl</ulink>) and use as
restraints by &MODELLER;.
</para>

<para>
More precisely, &MDT; uses a sample of sequences, structures, and/or
alignments to construct a table N(a,b,c,...,d) for features a, b, c, ..., d.
The sample for generating the frequencies N is obtained depending on the type
of features a, b, c, ..., d. The sample can contain individual proteins, pairs
of proteins, pairs of residues in proteins, pairs of aligned residues, pairs
of aligned pairs of residues, chemical bonds, angles, dihedral angles, and
pairs of tuples of atoms. Some features work with triple alignments, too.
All the needed features a, b, c, ..., d are calculated automatically from the
sequences, alignments, and/or &PDB; files. The feature bins are defined in
a bin file which can be changed by the user.
</para>

<para>
MDT works by accumulating the table N by processing each sequence or alignment
in turn. See <ulink url="&epydoc;mdt.add_alignment">mdt.add_alignment</ulink>.

<sect1 id="compilation">
<title>Compilation from source code</title>
<para>
You can get the current &MDT; code, by running the following:
</para>
<screen>
<command>svn co svn+ssh://synth.ucsf.edu/synth2/home/svn/imp/trunk imp</command>
</screen>

<para>
If you already have a copy of &MDT;, you can update it to the current code
by running
</para>
<screen>
<command>svn update</command>
</screen>

<para>
To compile, set the <varname>MODINSTALLSVN</varname> environment variable to
where you have &MODELLER; installed and run <command>scons</command> in the
<filename>imp/mdt</filename> directory (and optionally
<command>scons test</command>). To install, run
<command>scons install</command>, which will install the &MDT;
libraries in the same directories as &MODELLER;.
</para>

<sect1 id="running">
<title>Running &MDT; scripts</title>
<para>
To run a script <filename>foo.py</filename>, simply run
</para>
<screen>
<command>${MODINSTALLSVN}/bin/modpy.sh python <replaceable>foo.py</replaceable></command>
</screen>
</sect1>

<title>&MDT; reference</title>
<para>
See the <ulink url="epydoc/index.html">&MDT; reference manual</ulink> for
documentation on the &MDT; Python interface, generated automatically from
the source code.
